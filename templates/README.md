# Recursion

## Objective

This is a small app about recursion to give simple and concrete exemples for people not yet familiar with the concept.

## Requirements

You will flask and python installed and to start flask from the project folder.

## Operations

This app uses Python(and flask) and Javascript to calculate a animate simple recursive algorythms.

In the case of the hanoi tower all calculation are made client side with Javascript since i made the choice of limiting the ammount of possible disks (more would make the animation run for way to long).
So the scale of the computation remains relatively low.

For the fibonnaci sequence However the calculation will happen server side with Python since i wanted to be able to display like numbers of the sequence, and it was a lot more intensive even with memoization.

While the algorythms are fairly simple, the hard part for me was really the animations with javascript, especially since these sequence scale up so fast it because rapidly unrealistic to try to "demonstrate them".

## Roadmap

I also planned a 3rd presentation/animation showing how to find the determinant of large matrixes, but while again the algorythm in itself is fairly straight forward,
finding how to animate it in a way i'm satified with proved much harder than anticipated. But i still intend on trying to do it at a latter date.

I also plan to translate it in french once i find a tool to do so without manually finding every dom element with a block of text to be replaced at the press of a button.
Retrospectively, I should have probably planned for this from the start.

## Uses/Contribution

The project is completly open and if it so happens that anyone wishes to contribute, or to use it for educational purpose that's completely fine by me.
